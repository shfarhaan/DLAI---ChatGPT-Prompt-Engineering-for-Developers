# **Deep Learning AI - ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers**

## **Course Overview:**

In ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers, one will learn how to use a large 
language model (LLM) to quickly build new and powerful applications.  Using the 
OpenAI API, youâ€™ll be able to quickly build capabilities that learn to innovate 
and create value in ways that were cost-prohibitive, highly technical, or simply 
impossible before now. This short course taught by Isa Fulford (OpenAI) and 
Andrew Ng (DeepLearning.AI) will describe how LLMs work, provide best practices 
for prompt engineering, and show how LLM APIs can be used in applications for 
a variety of tasks, including:

- Summarizing (e.g., summarizing user reviews for brevity)
- Inferring (e.g., sentiment classification, topic extraction)
- Transforming text (e.g., translation, spelling & grammar correction)
- Expanding (e.g., automatically writing emails)
  
In addition, learning two key principles for writing effective prompts, 
how to systematically engineer good prompts, and also learn to build 
a custom chatbot. All concepts are illustrated with numerous examples, 
which a learner can play with directly in their Jupyter notebook environment 
to get hands-on experience with prompt engineering
